Visit the group choice activity. When the "Group choice" tab is visible, create
a text block in the right-hand drawer that contains the following code: 
<script src=”https://yourmoodle-site.domain/pluginfile.php/123456/mod_folder/content/0/mod_choicegroup_search.js”></script>
where the URL in the src attribute is specific to your installation and 
points to the js file within the ef4m repository folder. It is recommended 
that you copy the URL of the js file from the folder directly and paste it 
inside the src attribute above.
