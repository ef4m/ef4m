Visit the main course page where the course completion status block appears. Create a text block in the right-hand drawer that contains the following code: <script src=”https://yourmoodle-site.domain/pluginfile.php/123456/mod_folder/content/0/course_completion_block_enhancement.js”></script> where the URL in the src attribute is specific to your installation and points to the js file within the ef4m repository folder. It is recommended that you copy the URL of the js file from the folder directly and paste it inside the src attribute above. Save the text block and edit it again. Set the following settings:
